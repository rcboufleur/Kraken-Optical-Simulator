| --- | --- |
| `Name` | Human-readable label. |
| `Rc` | Radius of curvature. |
| `Thickness` | Distance to next surface. |
| `Glass` | Material after the surface. |
| `Diameter` | Outer aperture diameter. |
| `InDiameter` | Inner aperture diameter. |
| `k` | Conic constant. |
| `DespX`, `DespY`, `DespZ` | Decenter terms. |
| `TiltX`, `TiltY`, `TiltZ` | Tilt terms. |
| `AxisMove` | Coordinate-axis behavior after a transform. |

| `ZNK` | Zernike surface terms. |
| `Solid_3d_stl` | STL geometry path. |
| `Coating`, `CoatingMet` | Dielectric or metallic coating data. |

## `Kos.system`

Use `system` to assemble surfaces and trace rays.

Common methods:

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Trace(pS, dC, wV)` | Sequential ray trace. |

| `Parax(w)` | Paraxial calculation. |
| `SetData()` | Rebuild internal surface data after edits. |
| `SetSolid()` | Rebuild solid representation after edits. |

Common trace outputs:

| Attribute | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `val` | Validity of the most recent trace. |
| `SURFACE` | Surface sequence. |
| `NAME` | Surface names touched by the ray. |
| `GLASS` | Materials along the ray path. |
| `XYZ` | Global ray coordinates. |
| `OST_XYZ` | Local surface coordinates. |
| `LMN` | Incident direction cosines. |
| `R_LMN` | Resulting direction cosines. |
| `N0`, `N1` | Refractive indices before and after interfaces. |
| `OP`, `TOP`, `TOP_S` | Optical path information. |
| `RP`, `RS`, `TP`, `TS`, `TT` | Energy terms. |

## `Kos.raykeeper`

Use `raykeeper(system)` to store multiple ray traces from the same system.

Common methods:

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `push()` | Store the current ray from the system. |
| `pick(surface)` | Extract coordinates and direction cosines. |
| `clean()` | Clear stored rays. |
| `valid()` | Work with valid ray subsets. |

## `Kos.Setup`

Use `Setup` to configure catalog and material data.

Important concepts:

- default glass catalog loading
- deterministic catalog priority
- optional metal data loading
- configuration passed into `Kos.system`

## `Kos.PupilCalc`

Use `PupilCalc` to generate ray arrays from stop, aperture, and field settings.

Common attributes:

| Attribute | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Samp` | Sampling density. |
| `Ptype` | Pattern type, such as fan or hexapolar. |
| `FieldType` | Field interpretation, such as angle. |
| `FieldX`, `FieldY` | Field coordinates. |

Common method:

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Pattern2Field()` | Return ray origins and direction cosines. |
