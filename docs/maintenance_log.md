# KrakenOS Maintenance Log

This document is a handoff log for ongoing KrakenOS maintenance. Update it after
each working iteration so another assistant or maintainer can continue without
losing context.

## How To Use This Log

For each iteration, record:

- the goal;
- the files changed;
- the behavior protected or changed;
- the verification commands;
- the commit message suggested to the maintainer;
- any follow-up risks or next steps.

Keep entries factual and concise. Do not use this file as user-facing manual
documentation; use it as project continuity notes.

## Current Refactor Direction

KrakenOS keeps the public API stable:

```python
import KrakenOS as Kos

s = Kos.surf()
config = Kos.Setup()
system = Kos.system([s], config)
rays = Kos.raykeeper(system)
```

The internal goal is to reduce unnecessary PyVista coupling while preserving:

- sequential tracing behavior;
- non-sequential tracing behavior;
- STL solids;
- UDA polygons;
- masks and side-face interactions;
- existing examples and documentation.

PyVista remains justified as the current backend for 3D visualization, STL/mesh
geometry, masks, side faces, and ray-mesh intersection. The refactor should
remove or encapsulate PyVista only where it is acting as an unnecessary
container, conversion step, or eager dependency.

  them separately before including in any commit.

### 2026-05-17 - Centralize PyVista Normal Computation

Goal:

- Keep `Prerequisites3D.py` behavior unchanged while making PyVista normal
  computation easier to review and maintain.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/GeometryBackend.py`
- `KrakenOS/Prerequisites3D.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a shared `NORMAL_OPTIONS` dictionary to `GeometryBackend.py`.

  normal generation.
- Replaced three repeated `mesh.compute_normals(...)` calls in
  `Prerequisites3D.py` with `compute_normals(mesh)`.
- Preserved the same PyVista options, including `inplace=False`, so the mesh
  returned by PyVista is still used explicitly.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\GeometryBackend.py KrakenOS\Prerequisites3D.py
python tests\test_smoke.py
python tests\test_build_modes.py
python tests\test_examples_subset.py
```

Notes:

```

```text
- Add a shared compute_normals helper in GeometryBackend
- Route Prerequisites3D normal generation through the backend adapter
- Preserve existing PyVista normal options and returned-mesh behavior

  `python -m pytest tests`.
- Preserve the previous script-style test execution.

Files changed:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `tests/test_smoke.py`
- `tests/test_build_modes.py`
- `tests/test_examples_subset.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

python tests\test_smoke.py
python tests\test_build_modes.py
python tests\test_examples_subset.py
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 3 tests and all passed.
- The run reports many existing warnings, mostly `np.matrix`
  pending-deprecation warnings plus known numerical runtime warnings.

Suggested commit:

```text
Make tests discoverable by pytest
```

```text
- Add pytest-compatible test functions to existing test scripts
- Keep direct script execution working for the same checks
- Add pytest as an optional development dependency
- Update the maintenance log with verification notes

```

### 2026-05-17 - Add Public API Contract Test

Goal:

- Protect the traditional `import KrakenOS as Kos` public API before future
  changes to package-level imports.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_public_api.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a public API contract test for names used by current examples and
  documentation, including `surf`, `Setup`, `system`, `raykeeper`, display
  helpers, pupil tools, PSF/MTF helpers, wavefront helpers, and Zemax/lens
  catalog helpers.
- Added a construction smoke check for `surf`, `Setup`, `system(..., build=0)`,
  and `raykeeper`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 5 tests and all passed.
- Existing warnings remain noisy, especially `np.matrix`
  pending-deprecation warnings.

Notes:

- `Display2D`, `Display3D`, and `system_Lite` appear in searched text but are
  not currently exposed as `Kos.Display2D`, `Kos.Display3D`, or
  `Kos.system_Lite`. They were not added to the public API contract in this
  iteration.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add public API contract test
```

```text
- Add a pytest contract for public KrakenOS names used by examples
- Verify core objects can still be created through import KrakenOS as Kos

  current lightweight construction form: `Kos.system(..., build=0)`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Display.py KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Shift.py tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests
```

Additional check:

```python
import KrakenOS as Kos
assert Kos.Display2D is Kos.display2d
assert Kos.Display3D is Kos.display3d
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 5 tests and all passed.
- Existing warning noise remains unchanged.

Suggested commit:

```text
Restore legacy display aliases
```

```text
- Add Display2D and Display3D aliases for backward compatibility

- Replace an obsolete system_Lite comment with system(..., build=0)
- Update the maintenance log with verification notes
- Verify the full pytest suite
```

### 2026-05-17 - Add RayKeeper Result Ingestion Path

Goal:

- Prepare `raykeeper` for parallel tracing workflows where workers return
  extracted ray results instead of full `system` or `raykeeper` objects.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/RayKeeper.py`
- `tests/test_raykeeper_results.py`
- `tests/test_public_api.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `extract_ray_result(system)` to capture the current traced ray state
  without returning the full mutable system.
- Added `raykeeper.push_result(result)` to store one extracted result.
- Added `raykeeper.extend_results(results)` to ingest multiple extracted
  results.
- Kept the classic `system.Trace(...); rays.push()` workflow working by making
  `push()` call `push_result(extract_ray_result(self.SYSTEM))`.
- Added tests proving `push_result(extract_ray_result(system))` matches
  `push()` for valid and invalid rays.
- Added `extract_ray_result` to the public API contract.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\RayKeeper.py tests\test_raykeeper_results.py tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests\test_raykeeper_results.py tests\test_invalid_trace_results.py tests\test_public_api.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_performance_components.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- Targeted raykeeper/result tests passed.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.
- The performance component test showed `raykeeper.push()` still has measurable
  overhead compared with minimal extraction; this is now explicit and can be
  optimized later.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add RayKeeper result ingestion path
```

```text
- Add extract_ray_result for decoupling traced ray data from system objects
- Add push_result and extend_results to raykeeper
- Keep the classic push workflow as a compatibility wrapper
- Verify push_result matches push for valid and invalid rays
- Update the public API contract and maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-17 - Connect Parallel Trace Prototype To RayKeeper Results

Goal:

- Prove the intended parallel workflow end to end:
  worker-local tracing, extracted ray results, parent-process raykeeper
  reconstruction.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_parallel_trace.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Updated the parallel trace prototype so each worker calls
  `Kos.extract_ray_result(system)` after `Trace()`.
- Kept workers independent: each process owns its own `system(build=0)`.
- Added parent-process reconstruction through
  `raykeeper.extend_results(results)`.
- Compared the reconstructed raykeeper against a classic sequential
  `system.Trace(...); rays.push()` raykeeper.
- Preserved timing output for `parallel_total` and `parallel_warm_trace`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_parallel_trace.py
python -m pytest tests\test_parallel_trace.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `tests/test_parallel_trace.py` passed.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.
- Warm parallel timings still show useful speedup for moderate worker counts,
  while total time remains dominated by Windows process startup/import overhead.

Suggested commit:

```text
Connect parallel trace prototype to RayKeeper results
```

```text
- Use extract_ray_result inside parallel trace workers
- Rebuild raykeeper in the parent process with extend_results
- Compare reconstructed raykeeper data with the classic push workflow
- Preserve warm parallel timing diagnostics
- Verify the full pytest suite
```

### 2026-05-17 - Split Parallel Trace Benchmark From Pytest

Goal:

- Keep automated tests fast while preserving a reusable benchmark for parallel
  sequential tracing experiments.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_parallel_trace.py`
- `tools/benchmark_parallel_trace.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Reduced the pytest parallel trace coverage to a small deterministic case.
- Kept the correctness contract in pytest:
  sequential results, parallel worker results, and reconstructed raykeeper data
  must match.
- Added `tools/benchmark_parallel_trace.py` as a standalone benchmark for larger
  worker/ray-count sweeps.
- The benchmark reports both total multiprocessing time and warm trace time,
  making Windows process startup overhead visible.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_parallel_trace.py tools\benchmark_parallel_trace.py
python tools\benchmark_parallel_trace.py --rays 100 --workers 1 2
python -m pytest tests\test_parallel_trace.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- The standalone benchmark passed its sequential/parallel numerical
  validation.
- The short benchmark showed that total multiprocessing time is dominated by
  worker startup, while warm parallel tracing can already be faster than the
  sequential path.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.

Suggested commit:

```text
Split parallel trace benchmark from pytest
```

```text
- Keep pytest parallel trace coverage short and deterministic
- Add standalone warm parallel trace benchmark
- Validate benchmark results against sequential tracing
- Report total and warm multiprocessing timings separately
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-17 - Add Parallel Sequential Trace Example

Goal:

- Provide a user-facing example for the parallel-ready sequential tracing
  pattern validated by the tests and benchmark.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Parallel_Trace.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added an example that builds a lightweight `system(build=0)` inside each
  worker process.
- Traces deterministic ray batches in parallel with Windows-compatible
  multiprocessing `spawn`.
- Returns only serializable numerical ray results from workers.
- Reconstructs a parent-process `raykeeper` with `extend_results`.
- Prints sequential warm time, parallel total time, parallel warm trace time,
  and numerical validation status.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Parallel_Trace.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Parallel_Trace.py
```

Result:

- The example ran successfully on Windows.
- For 1000 rays and 4 workers, the example reported a warm trace speedup above
  2x while making the process startup overhead visible.
- Parallel and sequential numerical results matched.
- The reconstructed raykeeper contained all traced rays.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add parallel sequential trace example
```

```text
- Add example for worker-local build=0 sequential tracing

### 2026-05-17 - Add Simple Plane Fast Path

Goal:

- Avoid unnecessary Newton intersection and finite-difference normal
  evaluation for strict analytical z=0 plane surfaces.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/HitOnSurf.py`
- `KrakenOS/InterNormalCalc.py`
- `tests/test_simple_plane_fast_path.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `Hit_Solver.IsSimplePlane(j)` as a conservative internal predicate for
  traditional plane surfaces.
- `SolveHit()` now returns the already-known local plane hit directly for
  simple planes.
- `InterNormalCalc.__SigmaOutOrigSpace()` now computes the plane normal through
  the existing two-point transform convention instead of calling `SurfDer()`.
- Added code comments documenting why the fast path is intentionally narrow and
  why general surfaces stay on the original numerical path.
- Added tests proving:
  - simple plane tracing avoids Newton and finite-difference normals;
  - the fast path matches the original general solver when that path is forced.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\HitOnSurf.py KrakenOS\InterNormalCalc.py tests\test_simple_plane_fast_path.py
python -m pytest tests\test_simple_plane_fast_path.py -q
python -m pytest tests
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_performance_components.py -s
```

Result:

- Full test suite collected 15 tests and all passed.
- For the representative doublet trace counter, `SurfaceShape` calls dropped
  from 9034 to 7034 per 1000 rays and `SurfDer` calls dropped from 3000 to
  2000 per 1000 rays.
- End-to-end timing on the doublet changed little because the remaining
  spherical surfaces still dominate the cost; this confirms the next
  performance target should be conic/spherical intersection and normal logic.

### 2026-05-17 - Add Mixed Analytical Sag Derivatives

Goal:

- Use analytical sag derivatives when every active surface component can
  provide them, while preserving the existing finite-difference fallback for
  user-defined or sampled surfaces.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/MathShapesClass.py`
- `KrakenOS/SurfClass.py`
- `KrakenOS/HitOnSurf.py`
- `tests/test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added optional `derivative(x, y)` methods for:
  - conic/spherical surfaces;
  - polynomial aspheres;
  - axicons, except at the singular apex;
  - Zernike surfaces, following KrakenOS's existing `arctan2(x, y)`
    convention.
- Added optional derivative support for `ExtraData`:
  - existing `ExtraData = [surface, coef]` keeps the numerical fallback;
  - new `ExtraData = [surface, coef, derivative]` can return `(dzdx, dzdy)`.
- Added `surf.sigma_derivative(x, y, case)` to sum derivative contributions in
  the same order and with the same component stack used by `sigma_z()`.
- Updated `Hit_Solver.SurfDer()` to use analytical derivatives for surface
  normals when available.
- Updated Newton line solving to use the chain-rule derivative
  `dF/dz = dzdx * L/N + dzdy * M/N - 1` when available.
- Kept the finite-difference path as the automatic fallback whenever any active
  component cannot provide an analytical derivative.
- Added scalar fast paths to avoid creating tiny NumPy arrays during ray-by-ray
  tracing.

  aspheric, Zernike, and mixed surfaces.
- Existing `ExtraData` without derivative remains compatible and uses the
  numerical fallback.
- A mixed traced surface using analytical derivatives matched the forced
  finite-difference path.
- Representative doublet counters for 1000 rays:
  - `SurfaceShape` calls dropped from 7034 to 4876 after analytical Newton
    derivatives.
  - `SurfDer` calls remained at 2000, but those calls now use analytical
    normals when possible.
- `tests/test_trace_performance_components.py` reported:
  - `trace_only=0.177311s`
  - `trace_plus_minimal_extract=0.184357s`
  - `trace_plus_raykeeper_push=0.207696s`
- Parallel benchmark for 1000 rays and 4 workers reported:
  - `sequential_warm=0.166525s`

- `tests/test_examples_subset.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Traces the same ray bundle twice:
  - once with the analytical derivative path;
  - once with `sigma_derivative` disabled to force the numerical fallback.
- Prints RMS spot radius, maximum spot radius, centroid, and trace time.
- Plots analytical and numerical spot diagrams side by side.
- Added the example to the examples index and representative examples test.

### 2026-05-17 - Document Analytical And Numerical Derivatives

Goal:

- Make the new analytical/numerical derivative behavior part of the main user
  documentation, not only an implementation detail.

Files changed:

- `docs/manual/surfaces.md`
- `docs/manual/api_quick_reference.md`
- `docs/examples.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a dedicated section in the surfaces manual explaining:
  - why KrakenOS uses surface derivatives;
  - when analytical derivatives are used;
  - when numerical finite-difference fallback is preserved;
  - how combined sag terms also combine derivative terms.
- Documented supported analytical derivative terms:
  - planes;
  - conic/spherical/parabolic surfaces;
  - polynomial aspheres;
  - Zernike sag terms;
  - axicons away from the singular apex.
- Documented unsupported/fallback cases:
  - existing `ExtraData = [f, coef]`;
  - sampled `Error_map`;
  - singular points where an analytical derivative is not well defined.
- Added the optional user-defined derivative form:
  `ExtraData = [f, coef, df]`.

### 2026-05-17 - Clarify Parabolic Mirror Numerical Floor

Goal:

- Make the parabolic mirror comparison easier to interpret by showing that the
  remaining spot is a floating-point numerical floor, not a physical aberration.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py`
- `docs/manual/surfaces.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Updated the parabolic mirror derivative comparison example to plot residual
  spot coordinates with the centroid removed.
- Changed the plot scale to femtometers so the near-perfect analytical result
  is labeled honestly.
- Printed RMS and maximum radius in both millimeters and femtometers.
- Added an explicit note explaining that visible banding at this scale is a
  floating-point numerical floor.
- Added the same interpretation note to the surfaces manual.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py
$env:MPLBACKEND = "Agg"; python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py
```

Expected result:

### 2026-05-17 - Protect Vectorized Surface Derivatives

Goal:

- Preserve KrakenOS' existing ability to evaluate surface sag and derivatives
  over arrays of coordinates, preparing the ground for future bundle ray
  tracing without changing the current scalar `Trace()` workflow.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added tests proving that analytical derivatives accept vector `numpy` inputs
  for:
  - parabolic/conic surfaces;
  - conic plus aspheric terms;
  - Zernike terms;
  - axicon terms away from the apex.
- Added a vector finite-difference comparison for a mixed conic/asphere/Zernike
  surface.
- Kept the tests focused on surface math only; no optical physics or tracing
  algorithms were changed.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py -q
```

Expected result:

- All analytical derivative tests should pass.
- The new tests should confirm that vector inputs return vector derivatives
  with finite values and match vector finite differences.

Suggested commit:

```text

### 2026-05-17 - Prototype Vectorized SolveHit In Tests

Goal:

- Explore a bundle-style Newton ray-surface intersection solver without
  changing KrakenOS' current scalar `Trace()` implementation.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a test-local `solve_hit_bundle()` prototype that evaluates many
  ray-surface intersections at once using vector `numpy` arrays.
- Kept the prototype outside the KrakenOS package so the public API and scalar
  tracing behavior remain untouched.
- Compared the bundle solver against the existing scalar `Hit_Solver.SolveHit`
  for:
  - a simple plane;
  - a parabolic/conic surface;
  - a mixed conic/asphere/Zernike surface.
- Used the same Newton equation as the scalar solver:
  `F(z) = sag(x(z), y(z)) - z`.
- Used the analytical line derivative:
  `dF/dz = dzdx * L/N + dzdy * M/N - 1`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py -q
```

Result:

- All bundle intersection prototype tests passed.
- The prototype matched the scalar solver within tight numerical tolerances.

Suggested commit:

```text
Prototype vectorized SolveHit in tests
```

```text
- Add a test-local vectorized Newton intersection prototype
- Compare bundle SolveHit results against the scalar solver
- Cover plane, parabolic, and mixed conic/asphere/Zernike surfaces
- Keep the prototype outside the KrakenOS public API
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-17 - Benchmark Vectorized SolveHit Prototype

Goal:

- Measure whether the bundle-style Newton intersection prototype is worth
  developing further before moving any code into the KrakenOS core.

Files changed:

- `tools/benchmark_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added an exploratory benchmark comparing:
  - the existing scalar `Hit_Solver.SolveHit` in a Python loop;
  - a vectorized `solve_hit_bundle` prototype.
- Benchmarked parabolic/conic surfaces and mixed conic/asphere/Zernike
  surfaces.
- Kept the benchmark as a tool, not as a required pytest test.
- Documented the future bundle-tracing rule for aperture and mask misses:
  keep one boolean `active` mask per ray, mark missed rays inactive, and
  preserve original ray order in the arrays.
- Generated deterministic non-central ray bundles to avoid the singular
  Zernike derivative at exactly the origin.

Deferred follow-up:

- Define a robust policy for analytical-derivative singularities such as:
  - Zernike terms at the optical axis (`r = 0`);
  - axicon apex points;
  - conic limit points where the square-root derivative becomes singular;
  - any future user-defined analytical derivative with isolated undefined
    points.
- Candidate policy for future review: compute analytical derivatives for the
  regular subset of rays, and use the numerical derivative fallback only for
  singular rays inside the same bundle. This would preserve vector performance
  without rejecting an entire ray packet.

Verification:

```powershell
python tools\benchmark_solvehit_bundle.py --rays 100 1000 5000
python -m py_compile tools\benchmark_solvehit_bundle.py
```

Measured result:

```text

### 2026-05-17 - Prototype Bundle Active Aperture Mask

Goal:

- Clarify how a future vectorized ray bundle should handle rays that miss an
  aperture without deleting them from the packet.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a test-local `aperture_active_mask()` helper for the simple circular
  aperture contract.
- Added `solve_hit_bundle_with_aperture()` to demonstrate the future data
  shape:
  - keep hit coordinates for every input ray;
  - return an `active` boolean array of the same length;
  - mark rays outside the aperture inactive;
  - preserve original ray order.
- Added a test where rays at `x = +/-6 mm` miss a `10 mm` diameter aperture,
  while rays on or inside the edge remain active.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py -q
```

Expected result:

- Bundle SolveHit prototype tests should continue to pass.
- The active-mask test should prove that aperture misses do not remove rays
  from the packet.

Suggested commit:

```text
Prototype bundle active aperture mask
```

```text
- Add a test-local active-mask helper for bundle aperture handling
- Preserve ray order while marking aperture misses inactive
- Demonstrate bundle hit data with active flags
- Document singular derivative follow-up policy
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-17 - Validate Bundle Coordinate Transforms

Goal:

- Confirm that KrakenOS transform matrices can be applied to many ray points or
  directions at once, matching the current scalar matrix convention.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_bundle_transforms.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added test-local bundle transform helpers for:
  - points, using homogeneous `w = 1`;
  - directions, using homogeneous `w = 0`.
- Compared bundle transforms against the current scalar convention:
  `TRANS_1A[j].dot([x, y, z, w])`.
- Used a tilted and decentered surface so the test covers rotation and
  translation.
- Verified that directions are not translated.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py -q
```

Expected result:

- Bundle point transforms should match scalar matrix-dot transforms.
- Bundle direction transforms should match scalar matrix-dot transforms and
  keep homogeneous `w = 0`.

Suggested commit:

```text
Validate bundle coordinate transforms
```

```text

### 2026-05-17 - Prototype Sequential InterNormal Bundle

Goal:

- Combine bundle transforms, bundle intersection, bundle normals, and aperture
  active masks into a test-local prototype of the sequential `InterNormal`
  path.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_internormal_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a test-local `inter_normal_bundle()` prototype for simple sequential
  `TypeTotal == 0` surfaces.
- The prototype:
  - transforms start/stop ray points into local surface coordinates;
  - computes local ray directions;
  - solves intersections with the vectorized Newton helper;
  - computes local analytical normals as a bundle;
  - transforms hit points and normals back to global coordinates;
  - returns an `active` aperture mask while preserving ray order.
- Compared active bundle hit points, local hit points, normals, and local ray
  directions against the existing scalar `INORM.InterNormal()` path.
- Included one ray outside the aperture to verify inactive-ray behavior. The
  bundle may still compute geometric coordinates for inactive rays, but active
  comparisons are restricted to rays accepted by the aperture, matching the
  future active-mask contract.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_internormal_bundle.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py -q
```

Expected result:

- The bundle `InterNormal` prototype should match scalar `InterNormal` for
  active rays on a tilted/decentered sequential surface.
- The inactive aperture-miss ray should remain present in the packet with
  `active = False`.

Suggested commit:

```text
Prototype sequential InterNormal bundle
```

```text

- Combine bundle transforms, SolveHit, normals, and active aperture masks
- Compare active bundle results against scalar InterNormal
- Preserve inactive aperture-miss rays in the packet
- Update the maintenance log

### 2026-05-17 - Prototype Mini Sequential TraceBundle

Goal:

- Demonstrate that a small sequential ray bundle can be traced through multiple
  refractive surfaces and match the existing scalar `system.Trace()` workflow.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a test-local `trace_bundle()` prototype for a simple sequential lens.
- The prototype combines:
  - bundle coordinate transforms;
  - bundle ray-surface intersection;
  - bundle normal calculation;
  - bundle aperture active masks;
  - a test-local vectorized Snell/refraction calculation.
- Compared final hit points and final outgoing directions against scalar
  `system.Trace()` for the same rays.
- Kept the prototype entirely in tests; no KrakenOS package files or public API
  were changed.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
```

Expected result:

- The mini `TraceBundle` prototype should match scalar `Trace()` for a simple
  sequential refractive lens within numerical tolerance.

- Measure how much of the vectorized-intersection speedup remains when the
  prototype includes transforms, normals, aperture masks, and Snell physics.

Files changed:

- `tools/benchmark_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added an exploratory benchmark comparing:
  - scalar `system.Trace()` in a Python loop;
  - the test-local style mini `TraceBundle` algorithm.
- The benchmark uses a simple sequential refractive lens and validates bundle
  final hits and directions against scalar tracing before printing timings.
- Kept the benchmark outside the KrakenOS package and public API.

Verification:

```powershell
python tools\benchmark_trace_bundle.py --rays 100 1000 5000
python -m py_compile tools\benchmark_trace_bundle.py
```

Measured result:

### 2026-05-18 - Add Experimental BundleTrace Module

Goal:

- Move the repeated bundle-tracing prototype logic out of tests/tools and into
  one internal experimental module, without exposing it as public API.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `tests/test_bundle_transforms.py`
- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `tests/test_internormal_bundle.py`
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `tools/benchmark_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `tools/benchmark_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py` as an internal experimental module.
- Centralized the previously duplicated prototype helpers:
  - `transform_points_bundle`;
  - `transform_directions_bundle`;
  - `solve_hit_bundle`;
  - `local_normals_bundle`;
  - `aperture_active_mask`;
  - `inter_normal_bundle`;
  - `snell_refraction_bundle`;
  - `trace_bundle`.
- Kept the module intentionally out of `KrakenOS.__init__`, so it is not a
  public user-facing API yet.
- Updated bundle-related tests and benchmarks to import from the internal
  module instead of carrying local copies.
- Kept `system.Trace()`, `KrakenSys.py`, `InterNormalCalc.py`, and optical
  physics files unchanged.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python tools\benchmark_solvehit_bundle.py --rays 100 1000
python tools\benchmark_trace_bundle.py --rays 100 1000
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py tools\benchmark_solvehit_bundle.py tools\benchmark_trace_bundle.py
```

Expected result:

- Bundle tests should continue to pass against the centralized experimental
  module.
- Benchmarks should still validate scalar/bundle agreement before reporting
  timings.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add experimental BundleTrace module
```

```text

### 2026-05-18 - Expand TraceBundle Coverage

Goal:

- Exercise the experimental `trace_bundle()` helper against more realistic
  sequential cases before considering any public API or core integration.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `trace_bundle()` comparisons against scalar `system.Trace()` for:
  - a tilted/decentered refractive lens;
  - an asphere plus Zernike surface using off-axis rays;
  - rays that miss a small aperture and become inactive;
  - a flat mirror followed by an image plane.
- Updated the scalar comparison helper to handle invalid rays, whose scalar
  `R_LMN` payload is intentionally empty.
- Fixed the experimental mirror path in `BundleTrace.trace_bundle()`:
  - preserved the scalar propagation `SIGN` behavior after reflection;
  - used the post-physics absolute refractive index for the next surface,
    matching `Physics.calculate()` and scalar `Trace()`.

Verification:

python -m pytest tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py
```

Expected result:

- The experimental `trace_bundle()` should match scalar `Trace()` for the
  covered active rays.
- Aperture misses should preserve ray order and return matching active masks.

Suggested commit:

```text
Expand TraceBundle coverage
```

```text

- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Document Bundle Derivative Limits In Tests

Goal:

- Make the current experimental `BundleTrace` derivative requirements explicit
  before adding numerical fallback behavior.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added tests requiring clear `RuntimeError` behavior when bundle intersection
  cannot obtain analytical derivatives.
- Covered known singular/unsupported cases:
  - Zernike terms with a ray at the optical axis (`r = 0`);
  - axicon apex ray;
  - `ExtraData` without a user-provided derivative.
- Did not implement fallback behavior yet. These tests document the current
  boundary so future fallback work can be deliberate and easy to review.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py -q
```

Expected result:

- Existing bundle intersection tests should continue to pass.
- Unsupported derivative cases should fail with a clear message rather than a
  silent numerical mismatch.

Suggested commit:

```text
Document BundleTrace derivative limits
```

```text
- Add tests for BundleTrace derivative-limit errors
- Cover Zernike axis, axicon apex, and ExtraData without derivative
- Keep fallback behavior deferred for a focused follow-up
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add SolveHit Bundle Scalar Fallback

Goal:

- Let the experimental `solve_hit_bundle()` handle rays that cannot use the
  analytical derivative path, without giving up the fast vectorized path for
  ordinary analytical rays.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a scalar fallback inside `solve_hit_bundle()` using the existing
  `Hit_Solver.SolveHit` implementation.
- Kept the fast vectorized Newton path for surfaces/rays where
  `sigma_derivative()` returns analytical derivatives.
- When a vector derivative request returns `None`, `solve_hit_bundle()` now:
  - checks each unresolved ray individually;
  - keeps analytically supported rays in the vector Newton path;
  - sends singular or unsupported rays through the scalar solver;
  - preserves ray order in the returned arrays.
- Converted previous derivative-limit tests into fallback equivalence tests for:
  - Zernike terms with a central ray at `r = 0`;
  - axicon apex ray;
  - `ExtraData` without a user-provided derivative.
- Kept numerical fallback for bundle normals deferred; `local_normals_bundle()`
  still requires analytical derivatives.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py
```

Expected result:

- Bundle intersection should match scalar `SolveHit()` for normal analytical
  surfaces and for singular/unsupported rays handled by fallback.
- Full bundle tests should continue to pass.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add SolveHit bundle scalar fallback
```

```text
- Add scalar fallback for unsupported rays in solve_hit_bundle
- Preserve vectorized Newton for analytically supported rays
- Cover Zernike axis, axicon apex, and ExtraData without derivative
- Keep bundle normal fallback deferred
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add Bundle Normal Scalar Fallback

Goal:

- Let the experimental `local_normals_bundle()` compute normals for points
  where analytical derivatives are singular or unsupported, while preserving
  the vectorized path for ordinary analytical points.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added scalar normal fallback in `local_normals_bundle()` using the existing
  `Hit_Solver.SurfDer()` implementation.
- Kept analytical normals vectorized when `sigma_derivative()` succeeds for the
  whole packet.
- When vector derivative evaluation returns `None`, the bundle normal helper
  now:
  - checks each point individually;
  - keeps analytically supported points on the analytical path;
  - sends singular/unsupported points through scalar finite-difference normals;
  - preserves output order.
- Extended fallback tests to compare bundle normals against scalar
  `Hit_Solver.SurfDer()` for:
  - Zernike axis point;
  - axicon apex point;
  - `ExtraData` without derivative.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py
```

Expected result:

- Bundle intersections and normals should match the established scalar solvers
  for both analytical and fallback points.
- The full bundle test block should continue to pass.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add bundle normal scalar fallback
```

```text
- Add scalar fallback for unsupported points in local_normals_bundle
- Preserve vectorized analytical normals for supported points
- Compare fallback normals against Hit_Solver.SurfDer
- Cover Zernike axis, axicon apex, and ExtraData without derivative
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add Experimental Trace Bundle Example

Goal:

- Give users and maintainers a runnable example for the experimental sequential
  ray-bundle tracer, including fallback cases where analytical derivatives are
  singular or unavailable.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Trace_Bundle_Experimental.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/EXAMPLES_INDEX.md`
- `tests/test_examples_subset.py`
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added full `trace_bundle()` regression coverage for fallback cases:
  - Zernike central ray;
  - axicon apex ray;
  - `ExtraData` user surface without analytical derivative.
- Added a user-facing example that compares scalar `system.Trace()` against
  experimental `trace_bundle()` for:
  - a simple spherical lens using the vectorized path;
  - Zernike, axicon, and user-surface fallback paths.
- The example prints ray count, repetitions, active rays, scalar time, bundle
  time, speedup, active-mask equality, final-hit error, and direction error.
- Registered the example in the examples index and representative example test
  subset.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Trace_Bundle_Experimental.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Trace_Bundle_Experimental.py
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_bundle_transforms.py tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_internormal_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py tests\test_examples_subset.py -q
```

Expected result:

- The simple-lens bundle example should match scalar Trace to near machine
  precision and show a large speedup for repeated bundles.
- Fallback examples should match scalar Trace while remaining honest about
  their smaller speedup because individual singular rays still use scalar
  fallback.
- The representative examples test subset should continue to pass.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add experimental trace bundle example
```

```text
- Add trace_bundle example comparing scalar and bundle tracing
- Cover Zernike, axicon, and ExtraData fallback cases in full trace tests
- Register the example in the examples index and subset test
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add Parabolic Mirror Bundle Example

Goal:

- Provide a direct user-facing version of the shifted parabolic mirror
  derivative comparison that traces the whole ray set with the experimental
  `trace_bundle()` helper under the standard analytical-derivative condition.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_ParaboleMirror_Bundle_Comparison.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/EXAMPLES_INDEX.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a new example based on
  `Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py`.
- The example builds the same shifted parabolic mirror and deterministic pupil
  ray set, then compares:
  - scalar `system.Trace()` one ray at a time;
  - experimental `trace_bundle()` for all rays together.
- Both paths use analytical sag derivatives; the example no longer mixes this
  performance comparison with the forced numerical fallback mode.
- It reports timing, speedup, active-mask equality, final-hit error, direction
  error, RMS spot radius, maximum spot radius, and centroid.
- It plots the residual bundle spot at femtometer scale.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Bundle_Comparison.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Bundle_Comparison.py
```

Observed result:

- Analytical-derivative standard condition:
  - 697 rays;
  - scalar Trace time: about `0.090 s`;
  - bundle Trace time: about `0.001 s`;
  - speedup: about `88x`;
  - maximum final-hit error vs scalar: about `5.7e-14 mm`;
  - maximum direction error vs scalar: `0.0`.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add parabolic mirror bundle tracing example
```

```text
- Add shifted parabolic mirror example using trace_bundle
- Compare scalar Trace and bundled tracing with analytical derivatives
- Report timing, accuracy, and residual spot metrics
- Register the example in the examples index
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add Pupil Bundle Tracing Example

Goal:

- Demonstrate that `PupilCalc.Pattern2Field()` already produces ray-origin and
  direction arrays that can feed the experimental `trace_bundle()` workflow
  directly.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/EXAMPLES_INDEX.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a didactic doublet-lens pupil example based on
  `Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil.py`.
- The example computes pupil properties with `PupilCalc`, generates two field
  ray sets with `Pattern2Field()`, then compares:
  - scalar `system.Trace()` called one ray at a time;
  - experimental `trace_bundle()` called once for the whole pupil-ray bundle.
- The example keeps the ray set inside the normalized pupil rim
  (`r < 0.98`) so the comparison focuses on tracing speed and accuracy rather
  than floating-point inclusion at the exact aperture boundary.
- It reports ray count, active rays, scalar time, bundle time, speedup,
  active-mask equality, final-hit error, direction error, and RMS spot radius.
- It plots the image-plane bundle spot.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
```

Observed result:

- 542 pupil-generated interior rays;
- scalar Trace time: about `0.142 s`;
- bundle Trace time: about `0.0023 s`;
- speedup: about `62x`;
- same active mask: `True`;
- maximum final-hit error vs scalar: about `1.2e-14 mm`.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add pupil bundle tracing example
```

```text
- Add doublet pupil example using trace_bundle
- Feed PupilCalc Pattern2Field arrays directly into bundled tracing
- Compare scalar Trace and bundle Trace timing and accuracy
- Keep rays inside the pupil rim for clean active-mask comparison
- Register the example in the examples index
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Bridge Bundle Results Into RayKeeper

Goal:

- Let experimental bundle traces feed the existing `raykeeper` workflow, so
  bundled rays can be analyzed and plotted with familiar `raykeeper.pick()`
  patterns.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `KrakenOS/RayKeeper.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py`
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `keep_history=True` to `trace_bundle()` so the experimental tracer can
  retain per-surface global hits, local hits, incident directions, outgoing
  directions, local directions, and normals.
- Added `bundle_to_raykeeper_results()` to convert a history-enabled bundle
  result into the result dictionaries already accepted by `raykeeper`.
- Added `raykeeper.extend_bundle_result()` as an additive helper; existing
  `push()` and `extend_results()` behavior remains unchanged.
- Updated the doublet pupil bundle example to use:
  - `PupilCalc.Pattern2Field()`;
  - `trace_bundle(..., keep_history=True)`;
  - `raykeeper.extend_bundle_result(...)`;
  - `raykeeper.pick(-1)` for spot analysis.
- Added a regression test confirming that a bundle-loaded `raykeeper` matches
  scalar `system.Trace()` final positions and directions for a simple lens.

Current limitations:

- The reconstructed `raykeeper` records preserve geometry and direction data
  for analysis/display, but coating and energy bookkeeping are filled with
  neutral placeholder values until the bundled tracer implements full coating
  accounting.
- The feature remains experimental and internal.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py KrakenOS\RayKeeper.py KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
```

Observed result:

- Doublet pupil bundle example:
  - 542 interior pupil rays;
  - scalar Trace time: about `0.142 s`;
  - bundle Trace time with history: about `0.0025 s`;
  - speedup: about `58x`;
  - same active mask: `True`;
  - maximum final-hit error vs scalar: about `1.2e-14 mm`.
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`: `9 passed`.

Suggested commit:

```text
Bridge bundle traces into raykeeper
```

```text
- Add history output to experimental trace_bundle
- Convert bundle history into raykeeper-compatible records
- Add raykeeper.extend_bundle_result helper
- Use raykeeper in the pupil bundle example
- Cover raykeeper bundle loading in trace bundle tests
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Clarify Bundle RayKeeper Bookkeeping

Goal:

- Make the experimental bundle-to-raykeeper bridge explicit about which data are
  preserved today, and keep the optical-path bookkeeping aligned with scalar
  `Trace()`.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py`
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Corrected reconstructed optical path `OP` to use `N0`, the refractive index
  of the medium actually traveled by each segment, matching scalar `Trace()`.
- Extended the bundle raykeeper test to compare reconstructed `N0`, `N1`, `OP`,
  and `TOP` against a scalar `extract_ray_result()` record.
- Updated the pupil bundle example text to state the current conservation
  contract:
  - geometry and per-surface hit history are preserved;
  - directions are preserved;
  - surface IDs, names, glass names, `N0`, `N1`, distance, `OP`, and `TOP` are
    reconstructed;
  - polarization and coating/energy bookkeeping are currently neutral
    placeholders.
- The example now prints how many rays were loaded into `raykeeper` from the
  bundle result.

Next performance note:

- The next speed-oriented task remains vectorized numerical fallback for
  derivatives.  Current scalar fallback preserves compatibility but loses most
  of the bundle speedup for surfaces without analytical derivatives.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py KrakenOS\RayKeeper.py KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
```

Observed result:

- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`: `9 passed`.
- Doublet pupil bundle example:
  - 542 rays stored in `raykeeper` from bundle;
  - speedup about `57x`;
  - maximum final-hit error vs scalar about `1.2e-14 mm`;
  - scalar and bundle RMS spot values match.

Suggested commit:

```text
Clarify bundle raykeeper bookkeeping
```

```text
- Match bundle raykeeper OP/TOP bookkeeping to scalar Trace
- Test reconstructed N0, N1, OP, and TOP against scalar ray data
- Document which raykeeper fields are preserved and which remain placeholders
- Update the pupil bundle example output
- Note vectorized numerical derivative fallback as the next performance task
```

### 2026-05-18 - Reconstruct Bundle Energy Bookkeeping

Goal:

- Preserve the physical raykeeper fields that scalar `Trace()` stores for
  ordinary sequential geometric tracing, instead of leaving energy fields as
  neutral placeholders.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py`
- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Stored incidence angles in history-enabled `trace_bundle()` results.
- Updated `bundle_to_raykeeper_results()` to reconstruct:
  - `ALPHA`;
  - `BULK_TRANS`;
  - `RP`, `RS`, `TP`, `TS`;
  - `TTBE`;
  - `TT`.
- The reconstruction reuses existing scalar physics helpers:
  - `FresnelEnergy()`;
  - `system.CoatingFun()`.
- Extended the raykeeper bridge test to compare reconstructed energy and
  absorption fields against scalar `extract_ray_result()` for a simple lens.
- Updated the pupil bundle example wording to state that geometry, directions,
  indices, optical path, absorption, Fresnel/coating terms, and total
  transmission are preserved for the current sequential geometric path.

Current limitation:

- The bundle tracer still needs dedicated validation before being used for
  advanced polarization workflows or more complex coating/energy scenarios.
- The next performance task is still vectorized numerical derivative fallback,
  so surfaces without analytical derivatives do not lose most of the bundle
  speedup.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py KrakenOS\RayKeeper.py KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Doublet_Lens_Pupil_Bundle.py
```

Observed result:

- `tests/test_trace_bundle.py`: `9 passed`.

Suggested commit:

```text
Reconstruct bundle energy bookkeeping
```

```text
- Store incidence angles in history-enabled bundle traces
- Reconstruct ALPHA, Fresnel/coating terms, BULK_TRANS, TTBE, and TT
- Reuse existing scalar FresnelEnergy and CoatingFun helpers
- Compare reconstructed physical fields against scalar raykeeper records
- Update the pupil bundle example and maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add Vectorized Numerical Bundle Derivatives

Goal:

- Recover bundle performance for surfaces that do not provide analytical
  derivatives but whose sag function can evaluate NumPy arrays.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/BundleTrace.py`
- `tests/test_solvehit_bundle.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `numerical_derivative_bundle()` using a fourth-order finite-difference
  stencil over full coordinate arrays.
- `solve_hit_bundle()` now uses this vectorized numerical derivative when all
  active rays on a surface lack analytical derivatives and the sag function is
  array-compatible.
- `local_normals_bundle()` uses the same vectorized numerical derivative for
  all-unsupported derivative packets.
- Mixed packets, such as an axicon where only the apex ray is singular, keep
  the previous safe policy:
  - analytical derivative for supported rays;
  - scalar fallback only for singular/unsupported rays.
- Added tests for vectorized `ExtraData` without analytical derivative,
  including angled rays.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\BundleTrace.py
python -m pytest tests\test_solvehit_bundle.py tests\test_trace_bundle.py -q
```

Observed result:

- `18 passed`.
- Quick benchmark for 5000 `ExtraData` rays without analytical derivative:
  - scalar `SolveHit`: about `0.104 s`;
  - bundle `solve_hit_bundle`: about `0.0072 s`;
  - speedup: about `14.5x`;
  - max z error: about `8.3e-17`.

Notes:

- This does not replace analytical derivatives. Analytical derivatives remain
  the preferred and fastest path.
- This closes part of the performance gap for user surfaces, but full-system
  benchmarks should be expanded before making this public API.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add vectorized numerical bundle derivatives
```

```text
- Add vectorized finite-difference derivative fallback for bundle tracing
- Use it for array-compatible surfaces without analytical derivatives
- Preserve scalar fallback for mixed singular packets such as axicon apex rays
- Cover ExtraData without derivative and angled rays
- Record benchmark results in the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-18 - Add ExtraData Bundle Numerical Derivative Example

Goal:

- Provide a user-facing example showing how an `ExtraData` surface without an
  analytical derivative can still benefit from the experimental bundle tracing
  path through vectorized numerical derivatives.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_ExtraShape_Bundle_Numerical_Derivative.py`
- `KrakenOS/Examples/EXAMPLES_INDEX.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a didactic example using the classic:
  - `ExtraData = [surface_function, coefficients]`
- The example compares:
  - scalar `system.Trace()` one ray at a time;
  - experimental `trace_bundle(..., keep_history=True)`;
  - `raykeeper.extend_bundle_result(...)`;
  - final spot analysis through `raykeeper.pick(-1)`.
- The example reports ray count, active rays, scalar time, bundle time,
  speedup, active-mask equality, final-hit error, direction error, and RMS spot
  values.
- Registered the example in the examples index.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ExtraShape_Bundle_Numerical_Derivative.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ExtraShape_Bundle_Numerical_Derivative.py
```

Observed result:

- 1257 rays;
- scalar Trace time: about `0.219 s`;
- bundle Trace time: about `0.0047 s`;
- speedup: about `47x`;
- same active mask: `True`;
- maximum final-hit error vs scalar: about `2.7e-15 mm`;
- scalar and bundle RMS spot values match.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add ExtraData bundle numerical derivative example
```

```text
- Add user ExtraData bundle tracing example without analytical derivative
- Demonstrate vectorized numerical derivative fallback in trace_bundle
- Load bundle results into raykeeper and compare against scalar Trace
- Report timing, accuracy, and RMS spot values
- Register the example in the examples index
- Update the maintenance log
```
