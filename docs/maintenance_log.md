# KrakenOS Maintenance Log

This document is a handoff log for ongoing KrakenOS maintenance. Update it after
each working iteration so another assistant or maintainer can continue without
losing context.

## How To Use This Log

For each iteration, record:

- the goal;
- the files changed;
- the behavior protected or changed;
- the verification commands;
- the commit message suggested to the maintainer;
- any follow-up risks or next steps.

Keep entries factual and concise. Do not use this file as user-facing manual
documentation; use it as project continuity notes.

## Current Refactor Direction

KrakenOS keeps the public API stable:

```python
import KrakenOS as Kos

s = Kos.surf()
config = Kos.Setup()
system = Kos.system([s], config)
rays = Kos.raykeeper(system)
```

The internal goal is to reduce unnecessary PyVista coupling while preserving:

- sequential tracing behavior;
- non-sequential tracing behavior;
- STL solids;
- UDA polygons;
- masks and side-face interactions;
- existing examples and documentation.

PyVista remains justified as the current backend for 3D visualization, STL/mesh
geometry, masks, side faces, and ray-mesh intersection. The refactor should
remove or encapsulate PyVista only where it is acting as an unnecessary
container, conversion step, or eager dependency.

```

Follow-up:

- `KrakenOS/Display.py` and `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Interactive_Display.py`
  were already modified/untracked locally during this iteration context. Review
  them separately before including in any commit.

### 2026-05-17 - Centralize PyVista Normal Computation

Goal:

- Keep `Prerequisites3D.py` behavior unchanged while making PyVista normal
  computation easier to review and maintain.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/GeometryBackend.py`
- `KrakenOS/Prerequisites3D.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a shared `NORMAL_OPTIONS` dictionary to `GeometryBackend.py`.

  normal generation.
- Replaced three repeated `mesh.compute_normals(...)` calls in
  `Prerequisites3D.py` with `compute_normals(mesh)`.
- Preserved the same PyVista options, including `inplace=False`, so the mesh
  returned by PyVista is still used explicitly.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\GeometryBackend.py KrakenOS\Prerequisites3D.py
python tests\test_smoke.py
python tests\test_build_modes.py
python tests\test_examples_subset.py
```

Files changed:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `tests/test_smoke.py`
- `tests/test_build_modes.py`
- `tests/test_examples_subset.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added one `test_*` function to each existing test script.
- Kept each script's `main()` entry point, so direct execution still works.
- Added a `dev` optional dependency group with `pytest`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_smoke.py tests\test_build_modes.py tests\test_examples_subset.py
python tests\test_smoke.py
python tests\test_build_modes.py
python tests\test_examples_subset.py
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 3 tests and all passed.
- The run reports many existing warnings, mostly `np.matrix`
  pending-deprecation warnings plus known numerical runtime warnings.

Suggested commit:

```text
Make tests discoverable by pytest
```

```text
- Add pytest-compatible test functions to existing test scripts
- Keep direct script execution working for the same checks
- Add pytest as an optional development dependency

- `tests/test_public_api.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a public API contract test for names used by current examples and
  documentation, including `surf`, `Setup`, `system`, `raykeeper`, display
  helpers, pupil tools, PSF/MTF helpers, wavefront helpers, and Zemax/lens
  catalog helpers.
- Added a construction smoke check for `surf`, `Setup`, `system(..., build=0)`,
  and `raykeeper`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 5 tests and all passed.
- Existing warnings remain noisy, especially `np.matrix`
  pending-deprecation warnings.

Notes:

- `Display2D`, `Display3D`, and `system_Lite` appear in searched text but are
  not currently exposed as `Kos.Display2D`, `Kos.Display3D`, or
  `Kos.system_Lite`. They were not added to the public API contract in this
  iteration.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add public API contract test
```

```text
- Add a pytest contract for public KrakenOS names used by examples
- Verify core objects can still be created through import KrakenOS as Kos
- Record current non-exposed references for future review
- Update the maintenance log with verification notes
- Verify the full pytest suite
```

### 2026-05-17 - Restore Display Aliases And Remove Obsolete Lite Reference

  `Display3D = display3d` aliases.
- Added `Display2D` and `Display3D` to the public API contract test.
- Replaced the obsolete commented `Kos.system_Lite(...)` example with the
  current lightweight construction form: `Kos.system(..., build=0)`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Display.py KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Shift.py tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests
```

Additional check:

```python
import KrakenOS as Kos
assert Kos.Display2D is Kos.display2d
assert Kos.Display3D is Kos.display3d
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 5 tests and all passed.
- Existing warning noise remains unchanged.

Suggested commit:

```text
Restore legacy display aliases
```

```text
- Add Display2D and Display3D aliases for backward compatibility
- Include the legacy display aliases in the public API contract
- Replace an obsolete system_Lite comment with system(..., build=0)
- Update the maintenance log with verification notes
- Verify the full pytest suite
```

### 2026-05-17 - Add RayKeeper Result Ingestion Path

Goal:

- Prepare `raykeeper` for parallel tracing workflows where workers return
  extracted ray results instead of full `system` or `raykeeper` objects.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/RayKeeper.py`
- `tests/test_raykeeper_results.py`
- `tests/test_public_api.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `extract_ray_result(system)` to capture the current traced ray state
  without returning the full mutable system.
- Added `raykeeper.push_result(result)` to store one extracted result.
- Added `raykeeper.extend_results(results)` to ingest multiple extracted
  results.
- Kept the classic `system.Trace(...); rays.push()` workflow working by making
  `push()` call `push_result(extract_ray_result(self.SYSTEM))`.
- Added tests proving `push_result(extract_ray_result(system))` matches
  `push()` for valid and invalid rays.
- Added `extract_ray_result` to the public API contract.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\RayKeeper.py tests\test_raykeeper_results.py tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests\test_raykeeper_results.py tests\test_invalid_trace_results.py tests\test_public_api.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_performance_components.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- Targeted raykeeper/result tests passed.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.
- The performance component test showed `raykeeper.push()` still has measurable
  overhead compared with minimal extraction; this is now explicit and can be
  optimized later.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add RayKeeper result ingestion path
```

```text
- Add extract_ray_result for decoupling traced ray data from system objects
- Add push_result and extend_results to raykeeper
- Keep the classic push workflow as a compatibility wrapper
- Verify push_result matches push for valid and invalid rays
- Update the public API contract and maintenance log
```
