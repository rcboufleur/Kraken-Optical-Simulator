# KrakenOS Maintenance Log

This document is a handoff log for ongoing KrakenOS maintenance. Update it after
each working iteration so another assistant or maintainer can continue without
losing context.

## How To Use This Log

For each iteration, record:

- the goal;
- the files changed;
- the behavior protected or changed;
- the verification commands;
- the commit message suggested to the maintainer;
- any follow-up risks or next steps.

Keep entries factual and concise. Do not use this file as user-facing manual
documentation; use it as project continuity notes.

## Current Refactor Direction

KrakenOS keeps the public API stable:

```python
import KrakenOS as Kos

s = Kos.surf()
config = Kos.Setup()
system = Kos.system([s], config)
rays = Kos.raykeeper(system)
```

The internal goal is to reduce unnecessary PyVista coupling while preserving:

- sequential tracing behavior;
- non-sequential tracing behavior;
- STL solids;
- UDA polygons;
- masks and side-face interactions;
- existing examples and documentation.

PyVista remains justified as the current backend for 3D visualization, STL/mesh
geometry, masks, side faces, and ray-mesh intersection. The refactor should
remove or encapsulate PyVista only where it is acting as an unnecessary
container, conversion step, or eager dependency.

  them separately before including in any commit.

### 2026-05-17 - Centralize PyVista Normal Computation

Goal:

- Keep `Prerequisites3D.py` behavior unchanged while making PyVista normal
  computation easier to review and maintain.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/GeometryBackend.py`
- `KrakenOS/Prerequisites3D.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a shared `NORMAL_OPTIONS` dictionary to `GeometryBackend.py`.

  normal generation.
- Replaced three repeated `mesh.compute_normals(...)` calls in
  `Prerequisites3D.py` with `compute_normals(mesh)`.
- Preserved the same PyVista options, including `inplace=False`, so the mesh
  returned by PyVista is still used explicitly.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\GeometryBackend.py KrakenOS\Prerequisites3D.py
python tests\test_smoke.py
python tests\test_build_modes.py
python tests\test_examples_subset.py
```

Notes:

```

```text
- Add a shared compute_normals helper in GeometryBackend
- Route Prerequisites3D normal generation through the backend adapter
- Preserve existing PyVista normal options and returned-mesh behavior

  `python -m pytest tests`.
- Preserve the previous script-style test execution.

Files changed:

- `pyproject.toml`
- `tests/test_smoke.py`
- `tests/test_build_modes.py`
- `tests/test_examples_subset.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

python tests\test_smoke.py
python tests\test_build_modes.py
python tests\test_examples_subset.py
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 3 tests and all passed.
- The run reports many existing warnings, mostly `np.matrix`
  pending-deprecation warnings plus known numerical runtime warnings.

Suggested commit:

```text
Make tests discoverable by pytest
```

```text
- Add pytest-compatible test functions to existing test scripts
- Keep direct script execution working for the same checks
- Add pytest as an optional development dependency
- Update the maintenance log with verification notes

```

### 2026-05-17 - Add Public API Contract Test

Goal:

- Protect the traditional `import KrakenOS as Kos` public API before future
  changes to package-level imports.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_public_api.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a public API contract test for names used by current examples and
  documentation, including `surf`, `Setup`, `system`, `raykeeper`, display
  helpers, pupil tools, PSF/MTF helpers, wavefront helpers, and Zemax/lens
  catalog helpers.
- Added a construction smoke check for `surf`, `Setup`, `system(..., build=0)`,
  and `raykeeper`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 5 tests and all passed.
- Existing warnings remain noisy, especially `np.matrix`
  pending-deprecation warnings.

Notes:

- `Display2D`, `Display3D`, and `system_Lite` appear in searched text but are
  not currently exposed as `Kos.Display2D`, `Kos.Display3D`, or
  `Kos.system_Lite`. They were not added to the public API contract in this
  iteration.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add public API contract test
```

```text
- Add a pytest contract for public KrakenOS names used by examples
- Verify core objects can still be created through import KrakenOS as Kos

  current lightweight construction form: `Kos.system(..., build=0)`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Display.py KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Shift.py tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests
```

Additional check:

```python
import KrakenOS as Kos
assert Kos.Display2D is Kos.display2d
assert Kos.Display3D is Kos.display3d
```

Result:

- `pytest` collected 5 tests and all passed.
- Existing warning noise remains unchanged.

Suggested commit:

```text
Restore legacy display aliases
```

```text
- Add Display2D and Display3D aliases for backward compatibility

- Replace an obsolete system_Lite comment with system(..., build=0)
- Update the maintenance log with verification notes
- Verify the full pytest suite
```

### 2026-05-17 - Add RayKeeper Result Ingestion Path

Goal:

- Prepare `raykeeper` for parallel tracing workflows where workers return
  extracted ray results instead of full `system` or `raykeeper` objects.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/RayKeeper.py`
- `tests/test_raykeeper_results.py`
- `tests/test_public_api.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `extract_ray_result(system)` to capture the current traced ray state
  without returning the full mutable system.
- Added `raykeeper.push_result(result)` to store one extracted result.
- Added `raykeeper.extend_results(results)` to ingest multiple extracted
  results.
- Kept the classic `system.Trace(...); rays.push()` workflow working by making
  `push()` call `push_result(extract_ray_result(self.SYSTEM))`.
- Added tests proving `push_result(extract_ray_result(system))` matches
  `push()` for valid and invalid rays.
- Added `extract_ray_result` to the public API contract.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\RayKeeper.py tests\test_raykeeper_results.py tests\test_public_api.py
python -m pytest tests\test_raykeeper_results.py tests\test_invalid_trace_results.py tests\test_public_api.py -q
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_performance_components.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- Targeted raykeeper/result tests passed.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.
- The performance component test showed `raykeeper.push()` still has measurable
  overhead compared with minimal extraction; this is now explicit and can be
  optimized later.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add RayKeeper result ingestion path
```

```text
- Add extract_ray_result for decoupling traced ray data from system objects
- Add push_result and extend_results to raykeeper
- Keep the classic push workflow as a compatibility wrapper
- Verify push_result matches push for valid and invalid rays
- Update the public API contract and maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-17 - Connect Parallel Trace Prototype To RayKeeper Results

Goal:

- Prove the intended parallel workflow end to end:
  worker-local tracing, extracted ray results, parent-process raykeeper
  reconstruction.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_parallel_trace.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Updated the parallel trace prototype so each worker calls
  `Kos.extract_ray_result(system)` after `Trace()`.
- Kept workers independent: each process owns its own `system(build=0)`.
- Added parent-process reconstruction through
  `raykeeper.extend_results(results)`.
- Compared the reconstructed raykeeper against a classic sequential
  `system.Trace(...); rays.push()` raykeeper.
- Preserved timing output for `parallel_total` and `parallel_warm_trace`.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_parallel_trace.py
python -m pytest tests\test_parallel_trace.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- `tests/test_parallel_trace.py` passed.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.
- Warm parallel timings still show useful speedup for moderate worker counts,
  while total time remains dominated by Windows process startup/import overhead.

Suggested commit:

```text
Connect parallel trace prototype to RayKeeper results
```

```text
- Use extract_ray_result inside parallel trace workers
- Rebuild raykeeper in the parent process with extend_results
- Compare reconstructed raykeeper data with the classic push workflow
- Preserve warm parallel timing diagnostics
- Verify the full pytest suite
```

### 2026-05-17 - Split Parallel Trace Benchmark From Pytest

Goal:

- Keep automated tests fast while preserving a reusable benchmark for parallel
  sequential tracing experiments.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_parallel_trace.py`
- `tools/benchmark_parallel_trace.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Reduced the pytest parallel trace coverage to a small deterministic case.
- Kept the correctness contract in pytest:
  sequential results, parallel worker results, and reconstructed raykeeper data
  must match.
- Added `tools/benchmark_parallel_trace.py` as a standalone benchmark for larger
  worker/ray-count sweeps.
- The benchmark reports both total multiprocessing time and warm trace time,
  making Windows process startup overhead visible.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile tests\test_parallel_trace.py tools\benchmark_parallel_trace.py
python tools\benchmark_parallel_trace.py --rays 100 --workers 1 2
python -m pytest tests\test_parallel_trace.py -s
python -m pytest tests
```

Result:

- The standalone benchmark passed its sequential/parallel numerical
  validation.
- The short benchmark showed that total multiprocessing time is dominated by
  worker startup, while warm parallel tracing can already be faster than the
  sequential path.
- Full test suite collected 13 tests and all passed.

Suggested commit:

```text
Split parallel trace benchmark from pytest
```

```text
- Keep pytest parallel trace coverage short and deterministic
- Add standalone warm parallel trace benchmark
- Validate benchmark results against sequential tracing
- Report total and warm multiprocessing timings separately
- Update the maintenance log
```

### 2026-05-17 - Add Parallel Sequential Trace Example

Goal:

- Provide a user-facing example for the parallel-ready sequential tracing
  pattern validated by the tests and benchmark.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_Parallel_Trace.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added an example that builds a lightweight `system(build=0)` inside each
  worker process.
- Traces deterministic ray batches in parallel with Windows-compatible
  multiprocessing `spawn`.
- Returns only serializable numerical ray results from workers.
- Reconstructs a parent-process `raykeeper` with `extend_results`.
- Prints sequential warm time, parallel total time, parallel warm trace time,
  and numerical validation status.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Parallel_Trace.py
python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_Parallel_Trace.py
```

Result:

- The example ran successfully on Windows.
- For 1000 rays and 4 workers, the example reported a warm trace speedup above
  2x while making the process startup overhead visible.
- Parallel and sequential numerical results matched.
- The reconstructed raykeeper contained all traced rays.

Suggested commit:

```text
Add parallel sequential trace example
```

```text
- Add example for worker-local build=0 sequential tracing

### 2026-05-17 - Add Simple Plane Fast Path

Goal:

- Avoid unnecessary Newton intersection and finite-difference normal
  evaluation for strict analytical z=0 plane surfaces.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/HitOnSurf.py`
- `KrakenOS/InterNormalCalc.py`
- `tests/test_simple_plane_fast_path.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added `Hit_Solver.IsSimplePlane(j)` as a conservative internal predicate for
  traditional plane surfaces.
- `SolveHit()` now returns the already-known local plane hit directly for
  simple planes.
- `InterNormalCalc.__SigmaOutOrigSpace()` now computes the plane normal through
  the existing two-point transform convention instead of calling `SurfDer()`.
- Added code comments documenting why the fast path is intentionally narrow and
  why general surfaces stay on the original numerical path.
- Added tests proving:
  - simple plane tracing avoids Newton and finite-difference normals;
  - the fast path matches the original general solver when that path is forced.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\HitOnSurf.py KrakenOS\InterNormalCalc.py tests\test_simple_plane_fast_path.py
python -m pytest tests\test_simple_plane_fast_path.py -q
python -m pytest tests
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_performance_components.py -s
```

Result:

- Full test suite collected 15 tests and all passed.
- For the representative doublet trace counter, `SurfaceShape` calls dropped
  from 9034 to 7034 per 1000 rays and `SurfDer` calls dropped from 3000 to
  2000 per 1000 rays.
- End-to-end timing on the doublet changed little because the remaining
  spherical surfaces still dominate the cost; this confirms the next
  performance target should be conic/spherical intersection and normal logic.

### 2026-05-17 - Add Mixed Analytical Sag Derivatives

Goal:

- Use analytical sag derivatives when every active surface component can
  provide them, while preserving the existing finite-difference fallback for
  user-defined or sampled surfaces.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/MathShapesClass.py`
- `KrakenOS/SurfClass.py`
- `KrakenOS/HitOnSurf.py`
- `tests/test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added optional `derivative(x, y)` methods for:
  - conic/spherical surfaces;
  - polynomial aspheres;
  - axicons, except at the singular apex;
  - Zernike surfaces, following KrakenOS's existing `arctan2(x, y)`
    convention.
- Added optional derivative support for `ExtraData`:
  - existing `ExtraData = [surface, coef]` keeps the numerical fallback;
  - new `ExtraData = [surface, coef, derivative]` can return `(dzdx, dzdy)`.
- Added `surf.sigma_derivative(x, y, case)` to sum derivative contributions in
  the same order and with the same component stack used by `sigma_z()`.
- Updated `Hit_Solver.SurfDer()` to use analytical derivatives for surface
  normals when available.
- Updated Newton line solving to use the chain-rule derivative
  `dF/dz = dzdx * L/N + dzdy * M/N - 1` when available.
- Kept the finite-difference path as the automatic fallback whenever any active
  component cannot provide an analytical derivative.
- Added scalar fast paths to avoid creating tiny NumPy arrays during ray-by-ray
  tracing.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\MathShapesClass.py KrakenOS\SurfClass.py KrakenOS\HitOnSurf.py tests\test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py
python -m pytest tests\test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py -q
python -m pytest tests
python -m pytest tests\test_trace_performance_components.py -s
python tools\benchmark_parallel_trace.py --rays 1000 --workers 4
```

Result:

- Full test suite collected 19 tests and all passed.
- Analytical derivatives matched finite-difference slopes for conic,
  aspheric, Zernike, and mixed surfaces.
- Existing `ExtraData` without derivative remains compatible and uses the
  numerical fallback.
- A mixed traced surface using analytical derivatives matched the forced
  finite-difference path.
- Representative doublet counters for 1000 rays:
  - `SurfaceShape` calls dropped from 7034 to 4876 after analytical Newton
    derivatives.
  - `SurfDer` calls remained at 2000, but those calls now use analytical
    normals when possible.
- `tests/test_trace_performance_components.py` reported:
  - `trace_only=0.177311s`
  - `trace_plus_minimal_extract=0.184357s`
  - `trace_plus_raykeeper_push=0.207696s`
- Parallel benchmark for 1000 rays and 4 workers reported:
  - `sequential_warm=0.166525s`
  - `parallel_warm_trace=0.106552s`
  - `warm_speedup=1.563x`

  documentation, not only an implementation detail.

Files changed:

- `docs/manual/surfaces.md`
- `docs/manual/api_quick_reference.md`
- `docs/examples.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added a dedicated section in the surfaces manual explaining:
  - why KrakenOS uses surface derivatives;
  - when analytical derivatives are used;
  - when numerical finite-difference fallback is preserved;
  - how combined sag terms also combine derivative terms.
- Documented supported analytical derivative terms:
  - planes;
  - conic/spherical/parabolic surfaces;
  - polynomial aspheres;
  - Zernike sag terms;
  - axicons away from the singular apex.
- Documented unsupported/fallback cases:
  - existing `ExtraData = [f, coef]`;
  - sampled `Error_map`;
  - singular points where an analytical derivative is not well defined.
- Added the optional user-defined derivative form:
  `ExtraData = [f, coef, df]`.
- Updated the API quick reference with derivative behavior.
- Added task-oriented entries in the example guide for:
  - `Examp_ExtraShape_With_Derivative.py`;
  - `Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py`.

### 2026-05-17 - Clarify Parabolic Mirror Numerical Floor

Goal:

- Make the parabolic mirror comparison easier to interpret by showing that the
  remaining spot is a floating-point numerical floor, not a physical aberration.

Files changed:

- `KrakenOS/Examples/Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py`
- `docs/manual/surfaces.md`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Updated the parabolic mirror derivative comparison example to plot residual
  spot coordinates with the centroid removed.
- Changed the plot scale to femtometers so the near-perfect analytical result
  is labeled honestly.
- Printed RMS and maximum radius in both millimeters and femtometers.
- Added an explicit note explaining that visible banding at this scale is a
  floating-point numerical floor.
- Added the same interpretation note to the surfaces manual.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m py_compile KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py
$env:MPLBACKEND = "Agg"; python KrakenOS\Examples\Examp_ParaboleMirror_Derivative_Comparison.py
```

Expected result:

- The example should run successfully.
- The analytical case should remain around `5e-14 mm` RMS.
- The plot should show centered residuals in femtometers, making the numerical
  floor explicit.

Suggested commit:

```text
Clarify parabolic mirror numerical floor
```

```text

### 2026-05-17 - Protect Vectorized Surface Derivatives

Goal:

- Preserve KrakenOS' existing ability to evaluate surface sag and derivatives
  over arrays of coordinates, preparing the ground for future bundle ray
  tracing without changing the current scalar `Trace()` workflow.

Files changed:

- `tests/test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py`
- `docs/maintenance_log.md`

Changes:

- Added tests proving that analytical derivatives accept vector `numpy` inputs
  for:
  - parabolic/conic surfaces;
  - conic plus aspheric terms;
  - Zernike terms;
  - axicon terms away from the apex.
- Added a vector finite-difference comparison for a mixed conic/asphere/Zernike
  surface.
- Kept the tests focused on surface math only; no optical physics or tracing
  algorithms were changed.

Verification:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests\test_surface_analytic_derivatives.py -q
```

Expected result:

- All analytical derivative tests should pass.
- The new tests should confirm that vector inputs return vector derivatives
  with finite values and match vector finite differences.

Suggested commit:

```text

```

```text

### 2026-05-18 - Move High-Performance Work To Private Repository

Goal:

- Keep the public KrakenOS repository focused on the stable optical simulator while continuing high-performance experiments in a private repository.

Decision:

- High-performance ray-bundle development has been copied to `C:\Users\ADMIN1\Documents\GitHub\KrakenCore`.
- Public KrakenOS should not expose or ship the experimental bundle tracing module, benchmarks, tests, or examples.
- Analytical surface derivatives remain part of public KrakenOS because they improve the existing scalar tracing path without changing the public API.

Public repository cleanup:

- Removed experimental bundle tracing code and examples from the public tree.
- Removed public tests and benchmarks dedicated to the private high-performance path.
- Removed the raykeeper helper that depended on the private bundle implementation.
- Removed detailed public maintenance-log entries describing the private high-performance implementation.

Suggested commit:

```text
Move high-performance bundle work to private repo
```

```text
- Remove experimental bundle tracing code from public KrakenOS
- Remove public bundle examples, tests, and benchmarks
- Keep analytical derivative improvements in the public scalar tracer
- Record migration of high-performance work to private KrakenCore repo
```
