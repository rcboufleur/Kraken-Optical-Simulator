# KrakenOS Documentation

This folder has one intended entry point: the modern
[KrakenOS Manual](manual/README.md). The other documents support that
manual instead of replacing it.

## Recommended Reading Path

1. [KrakenOS Manual](manual/README.md)

   Start here if you are learning KrakenOS. It explains the current workflow:
   installation, core concepts, surfaces, materials, ray tracing, visualization,
   pupils, analysis, and advanced examples.

2. [Example Guide](examples.md)

   Use this when you already know what you want to do and need a runnable
   script to start from.

3. [Generated Examples Appendix](examples_manual.md)

   Use this as the visual appendix. It is generated from example docstrings and
   includes reproducible 2D and 3D figures for selected examples.

4. [Capabilities Overview](capabilities.md)

   Use this as a feature map of the current codebase.

5. [Example Coverage Roadmap](example_coverage.md)

   Use this to decide which examples and documentation areas should be improved
   next.

6. [PSF and MTF Notes](psf_mtf_notes.md)

   Use this for focused notes on the compact PSF/MTF helpers.
